<p>While Weimaraners are typically known for their solid gray or blue coats, they don’t start out that way.

Like a reverse Dalmatian–who are born spotless–Weimaraner puppies earn their solid coats over time. Weimaraner puppies have darker tiger stripes that fade a few days after birth.

Weimaraner puppies also have piercing blue eyes when they’re born. This doesn’t mean your Weimaraner puppy’s eyes will stay blue, though. When the pups are born, their eyes don’t produce enough melanin to give them any distinctive color.

There isn’t an exact deadline on those baby blues, but many Weimaraner puppies typically gain enough melanin for brown, amber, or blue-grayish eyes between the ages of two and six months.
